Intelligence - being capable
AI - automating Intelligence

ANI - weak AI. particular activity. e.g. recommendation,chatbot
AGI - [hyperon]. needed to acheive IQ. three things needed to actualize : solving general problem, ?, and learning in random env't
discussions:
is llm AGI?
what is turing-thesis?
ASI - exceed human capacity. features : learn new things, creat new things, .put human's existence in danger.
*AGI and ASI are not achieved.

Agent - body act over an environment. sense with sensor and act with acutator. 

**DSA in AI**

*Graph*
directed graph - 
undirected graph -
graphical representation: matrix, adjency list

**searching algorithm**
*BFS* - find a vertex , put in queue, iteratively deque the list and visit it until queue got empty.
*DFS* - find a vertex, use stack, traverse the nodes

path generating - assignment(path: ~project/icog/assigment1.py) - STATUS NOT DONE 

"""
link to assignment [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B7vHTmsHvzEcwb345lTlx6OjsmHFdIcNR2E_97tgU28/edit] 
clear implementation, variable naming, box tree for methods

2. read text file and return graph object [city] and then implement a BFS | DFS and return path in list 

str, repr - override
hint - use dict, don't regenerate similar cities
use comment in a function as a requirement
graphical representation

"""
**Evolutionary algorithm(genetic)**

genetic algorithm [use variant in hyperon]

1. generate solutions function
2. hold the solutions as population
3. do fitness for population [fitness function mesaure each population]
4. select fitted and do cross over
5. new generation created
6.
